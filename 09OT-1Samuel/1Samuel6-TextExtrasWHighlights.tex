[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Then said they, What \emph{shall} \emph{be} the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, \emph{according} \emph{to} the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague \emph{was} on you all, and on your lords.}
[5] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.}
[6] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?}

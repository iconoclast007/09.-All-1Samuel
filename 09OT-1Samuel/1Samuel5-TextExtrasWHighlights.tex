[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon \emph{was} fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands \emph{were} \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{cut off} upon the threshold; only \emph{the} \emph{stump} \emph{of} Dagon was left to him.}

[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{\fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{And} they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.}

[10] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{\fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{And} they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.}
[11] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{\fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{And} the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out \fcolorbox{bone}{bone}{of the} hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.}
